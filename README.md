A demo of Datatables + jQuery - because it could be useful.

## Getting started

Use your favourite JavaScript package manager - `npm` or `yarn` and perform an `install` followed by a `start` command.

It may look like this:
```
yarn install
yarn start
```

Or, if you're running `npm`, like this:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Once done you'll have a webpack development server running at `localhost:8080`.
Go there to see `index.html` in action!
Explore the code placed in `src/` to see how it all comes together.
